- Support sitemap?
	- Contributions are welcome, but I (Mark) will probably not write this.

- Does the response header have to contain the full path?

- Headers for redirection pages, like /en/ redirecting to /en-gb/ or /en-us/ based on user
	- I am not sure if there is a standard way this is implemented in Django, so not making it yet
